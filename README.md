## Group 5 Project 1

Project for Intro to Data Science, Fall 2022

The aim of the project is to use exploratory data analysis to answer SMART questions about a dataset.

## Research Background:

For a long time, we’ve liked to engross ourselves in fables and stories for ranging purposes. Cinema has become the modern medium to achieve this. From documentaries to action thrillers, it has become an integral part of any community; movies mirror what we believe and help redefine the narrative on how we see others in the world. Whether they’re utilized as a medium to relax after work or school, address key issues to drive social change, or therapeutically to tackle mental health, movies drive and shape our societies.

## Proposal and Dataset:

GroupLens is a research lab in the Dept. of Computer Science of University of Minnesota, which among other things, specializes in a movie recommendation system through MovieLens, that utilizes user ratings to recommend movies to its users. Using two datasets, one with 10,329 movies and their genres, and another with 105,339 IMDB ratings (scale of 5) across 668 Users (selected randomly) between March 1996 and September 2018, we can perform exciting exploratory analysis of movie ratings, genres, and user preference. We have compiled both datasets into a single dataset and also split the genres variable into multiple unique rows to be able to utilize them. This has increased the observations of the final dataset to 299,937.

## SMART Questions

Some SMART questions we want to explore are the following:

* Which movie has the highest average rating across the user population between March 1996 and September 2018?
* What is the average ratings of each genre using the movies in the sample, across the user population between March 1996 and September 2018?
* Which genre is watched the most number of times by the user population between March 1996 and September 2018?
* Which genre has the highest average rating using movies in the sample, across the user population between March 1996 and September 2018?
* Which movie displays the maximum mixed reviews from the user population between March 1996 and September 2018?
* Which genre displays the maximum mixed reviews, using the movies in the sample, from the user population between March 1996 and September 2018?

This could provide good insight into certain biases when it comes to rating movies, genres watched most by viewers, and how this could affect movie recommendation systems.
